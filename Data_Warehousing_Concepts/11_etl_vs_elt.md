# ETL vs. ELT: Integrating Data into a Data Warehouse  

## Overview  
- **ETL (Extract → Transform → Load):** Data is transformed before being loaded into the data warehouse.  
- **ELT (Extract → Load → Transform):** Data is first loaded into the data warehouse and then transformed.  

## Comparison Table  

| Feature           | ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)                                  | ELT (Extract → Load → Transform)                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transformation** | Performed before loading into the data warehouse.              | Performed within the data warehouse after loading.       |
| **Infrastructure** | Requires a separate system for processing transformations.      | Uses the data warehouse’s computing power for transformations. |
| **Pros**         | - Lower data storage costs. <br> - Easier **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** security compliance, as sensitive data can be removed before loading. | - No need for separate infrastructure. <br> - Transformations can be rerun without affecting source systems (OLTP). <br> - Supports near real-time processing since only loading is required initially. |
| **Cons**         | - Transformation errors or changes require re-extracting data, slowing OLTP systems. <br> - Additional costs for separate processing systems. | - Raw data is loaded, increasing storage needs. <br> - Compliance with **PII security standards** can be more challenging. |


### Note  
- **ELT adoption has grown** with the rise of cloud data warehouses, as cloud platforms enable **endless storage** and **parallel computing power** for efficient transformations.
