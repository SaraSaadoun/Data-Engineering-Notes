# 🔄 OLAP vs. OLTP  

## 📊 OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)  
- **Optimized for analysis** (read-only queries).  
- Stores **data in multiple dimensions** (not just rows & columns) for fast analytical processing.  
- **Supports slicing & dicing** of data for deep insights.  
- Uses an **OLAP Cube** for rapid aggregation and disaggregation based on selected dimensions.  

### 📦 OLAP Cube Example:  
- **Dimensions:** `Product × Year × Region`  
- **Aggregated Value:** `Total Sales`  
- If dimensions exceed 3, it's called a **Hypercube**.

## 📝 OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)  
- **Optimized for real-time transactional processing** (insert, update, delete operations).  
- Stores **data in traditional rows & columns format**.  
- Designed for **fast and frequent small transactions**.
