# On-Premise vs Cloud Data Warehousing  

## 1. On-Premise Data Warehouse  

- The organization **purchases servers** and **installs software locally** (on the organizationâ€™s premises).  

### Pros  
- Full **control** over infrastructure and data.  
- Ability to implement **custom data governance** (access permissions, security policies).  
- **Local network speed** can enhance performance.  
- Can **optimize workloads** based on internal requirements.  

### Cons  
- High **initial and ongoing costs** (hardware, licenses).  
- Requires personnel staff for maintenance and support.  
- Responsibility for **patches**, upgrades, and security lies with the organization.

## 2. Cloud Data Warehouse  

- Rapidly growing adoption.  
- Most providers offer it as **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**.  

### Pros  
- No need for **hardware, infrastructure, or ongoing maintenance**.  
- Frees up personnel.  
- **Scalable storage and compute power** on demand.  
- No capital expenses for servers and equipment.  

### Cons  
- **Less control** over infrastructure and customization.  
- Limited ability to **optimize DWH workloads**.  
- **Unanticipated costs** may occur due to pay-as-you-go pricing models.

## 3. Hybrid Approach  

- Combines on-premise and cloud environments.  

### Common Use Cases  
- **Backup** and **disaster recovery** solutions.
